    description = """\
Sidero UI is getting the next iteration of the design.
The color scheme was aligned to the new Sidero company color scheme.

Main changes UX-wise:
- all clusters are now placed in the context dropdown: both kubeconfig clusters and CAPI clusters.
- now it is possible to see Kubernetes upgrades history (dropped after theila restart as of now).
- pod information has got more details.
- servers list is now also available for CAPI clusters.
- now the UI provides summary page for cluster resources usage.
"""

  [notes.config]
    title = "Configuration Priority Changes"
    description = """\
Starting from 0.2.1 Theila no longer relies on the local Kubeconfig.
Instead it fetches the initial list of cluster from `~/.talos/config` or whatever is set in the `TALOSCONFIG`
environment variable.
It helps to get rid of strong requirement for matching context in `~/.kube/config` and `~/.talos/config` as
Kubernetes config is now always retrieved from the Talos API.

> Note: due to change in that flow it may be required to drop browser local storage cache for your Theila page as it will have
an old context name cached there.
