Sidero UI is getting the next iteration of the design.
The color scheme was aligned to the new Sidero company color scheme.

Main changes UX-wise:
- all clusters are now placed in the context dropdown: both kubeconfig clusters and CAPI clusters.
- now it is possible to see Kubernetes upgrades history (dropped after theila restart as of now).
- pod information has got more details.
- servers list is now also available for CAPI clusters.
- now the UI provides summary page for cluster resources usage.
