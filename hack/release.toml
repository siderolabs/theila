    title = "The First Release"
    description = """\
This is the very first release of the UI for Talos and Sidero.

Theila gets credentials from `~/.kube/config` or from the file defined in `KUBECONFIG`
environment variable.

For each cluster it is possible to get the list of nodes and pods.

If Sidero is deployed then the UI:
- shows the list of servers.
- shows the list of clusters (for any CAPI provider).
- allows getting kubeconfig and talosconfig for each Sidero cluster.
- provides a way to accept metal servers.

For each node in the cluster it is possible to:
- get the list of services and their health.
- get node logs.
- get performance metrics.
- get each internal service logs (etcd, apid, machined and so on).
- reboot the node.
- reset the node EPHEMERAL partition.

    title = "Kubernetes Upgrade Automation"
    description = """\
Both current cluster and CAPI cluster Kubernetes components can be upgraded right from
the web.
Theila manages in-memory internal state of ongoing upgrades and presents progress and logs
back to the web.
Upgrade flow is the same as for `talosctl upgrade-k8s` cli command, except for the fact that Theila
maintains Kubernetes versions list. So when upgrade is initialized Theila can present list of versions
it can upgrade to.
